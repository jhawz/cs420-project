**PREREQUISITES**

- CMAKE (www.cmake.org)
- SFML 2.1 (www.sfml-dev.org)


**COMPILE**

Run 'cmake .' to generate the Makefile.  If SFML is not installed in a standard search path, then CMake will not be able to find the required cmake module 'FindSFML.cmake'.  You can direct CMake to look for it in a specific location by setting the environment varibale 'CMAKE_MODULE_PATH'. For example assuming bash and SFML installed in ~/local

export CMAKE_MODULE_PATH=~/local/share/SFML/cmake/Modules
cmake .

To compile, simply run 'make'. If SFML was installed correctly, a executable 'helloworld' will be generated.


**ADDING FILES**

If you want to add an executable, just add the corresponding .cpp file in the 'bin' subdirectory, and _rerun_ 'cmake .' to update the Makefiles.
If you want to add a source file, just add the corresponding .cpp file in the 'src' subdirectory, and _rerun_ 'cmake .' to update the Makefile.
If you want to add a header file, just add the corresponding .h file to the 'include' subdirectory. You do not need to update the Makefile.


**CLEANING UP**

If you want to remove all compiled files, just run 'make clean'.  This will remove every .o file and executable.  It will not however remove any of the files generated by CMake.
If you want to obtain a completely clean copy of your code, you can run the provided script (linux only): 'scripts/cmake_cleanup'
